# Yolo V3

> You only look once (YOLO) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. On a Pascal Titan X it processes images at 30 FPS and has a mAP of 57.9% on COCO test-dev.

### Description:

- **Input resolution**: 320x320, 416x416 (and other multiple of 32)
- **Pretrained**: COCO
- **Weights size**: ~250 mb
- **Work modes**: train, inference, deploy
- **Usage example**: [Multi-class object detection using YOLO V3](https://docs.supervise.ly/neural-networks/examples/yolo_v3/)

### Train configuration
_General train configuration available in model presets._ 

Also you can read common training configurations [documentation](https://docs.supervise.ly/neural-networks/configs/inference_config/).

- `lr` - Learning rate.
- `epochs` - the count of training epochs.
- `batch_size` - batch sizes for training (`train`) stage.
- `input_size` - input images dimension `width` and `height` in pixels.
- `bn_momentum` - batch normalization momentum parameter.
- `gpu_devices` - list of selected GPU devices indexes.
- `data_workers` - how many subprocesses to use for data loading.
- `dataset_tags` - mapping for split data to train (`train`) and validation (`val`) parts by images tags. Images must be tagged by `train` or `val` tags.
- `subdivisions` - split batch on subbatches (if big batch size does not fit to GPU memory).
- `special_classes` - objects with specified classes will be interpreted in a specific way. Default class name for `background` is `bg`, default class name for `neutral` is `neutral`. All pixels from `neutral` objects will be ignored in loss function.
- `print_every_iter` - allow to output training information every `N` iterations. 
- `weights_init_type` - can be in one of 2 modes. In `transfer_learning` mode all possible weights will be transfered except last layer. In `continue_training` mode all weights will be transfered and validation for classes number and classes names order will be performed.
- `enable_augmentations` - current implementation contains strong augmentation system. If you want to use it select `true` or `false` otherwise.

Full training configuration example:

```json
{
    "lr": 0.0001,
    "epochs": 10,
    "batch_size": {
      "train": 8
    },
    "input_size": {
      "width": 416,
      "height": 416
    },
    "bn_momentum": 0.01,
    "gpu_devices": [0],
    "data_workers": {
      "train": 3
    },
    "dataset_tags": {
      "train": "train"
    },
    "subdivisions": {
      "train": 1
    },
    "print_every_iter": 10,
    "weights_init_type": "continue_training",
    "enable_augmentations": true
  }
```

### Inference configuration

For full explanation see [documentation](https://docs.supervise.ly/neural-networks/configs/inference_config).

**`model`** - group contains unique settings for each model:
 
  * `gpu_device` - device to use for inference. Right now we support only single GPU.
  
  * `confidence_tag_name` - name of confidence tag for predicted bound boxes.
 
 
**`mode`** - group contains all mode settings:

  *  `name` - mode name defines how to apply NN to image (e.g. `full_image` - apply NN to full image)
   
  *  `model_classes` - which classes will be used, e.g. NN produces 80 classes and you are going to use only few and ignore other. In that case you should set `save_classes` field with the list of interested class names. `add_suffix` string will be added to new class to prevent similar class names with exisiting classes in project. If you are going to use all model classes just set `"save_classes": "__all__"`.


Full image inference configuration example:

```json
{
  "model": {
    "gpu_device": 0,
    "confidence_tag_name": "confidence"
  },
  "mode": {
    "name": "full_image",
    "model_classes": {
      "save_classes": "__all__",
      "add_suffix": "_yolo"
    }
  }
}
